There are several different conditions but they share some similar features. The most important common feature is the risk of the heart suddenly going in to a fast, abnormal rhythm that can cause fainting or blackouts or, in the most severe cases, a cardiac arrest. In many individuals there are no other symptoms and so the treatments are aimed at reducing the risk of dangerous heart rhythms and preventing sudden cardiac arrest.":{"con":{},"att":""}},"att":""},"Where do they come from?":{"con":{"Inherited heart rhythm conditions are generally caused by changes in a person’s genes and in particular the genetic code that programs the way the heart develops. Although the genetic changes are present from birth, signs of the condition may not develop until later in life. As a person’s genes are inherited from their parents, these conditions can run in families. Sometimes, however, the genetic change arises in a person for the first time. Additional factors including other genes, use of certain medications, and levels of physical activity can affect the severity of the conditions so that, even within a single family, there may be a wide variation in the severity of an inherited heart rhythm condition.":{"con":{},"att":""}},"att":""},"How Are They Diagnosed":{"con":{"To diagnose an inherited heart rhythm condition, individuals will undergo a series of tests to assess for the presence of the heart condition. Testing includes a number of clinical tests and also genetic testing (blood sample) to determine the likelihood of having the heart condition. No single test is all encompassing, and individuals will also receive a formal assessment from a heart rhythm physician to see if he or she is at risk. ":{"con":{},"att":""}},"att":""},"How Research Helps Diagnostics":{"con":{"Our understanding of inherited heart rhythm conditions continues to evolve. There are still many elements to each disease that we do not understand, highlighting the importance of HIRO.

However, it is common for a condition not to cause any symptoms on a day-to-day basis and many people with an inherited heart rhythm condition lead very normal lives. Some people may take medication to reduce the risk of dangerous heart rhythms or, less commonly, an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) may be recommended. This is a device that will detect and treat life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms.

Therefore, it is recommended that close relatives be checked for the same condition. There can be significant variation in the severity of a condition even between close relatives and this can sometimes be confusing. Family members may wish to learn more about the specific condition affecting their relative, in particular the symptoms or signs to look out for. Some may even decide to learn basic life support skills to use in the event of a cardiac arrest.

However, there may be some things to consider if you are diagnosed with an inherited heart rhythm condition. You may be prescribed medication to help reduce the risk of dangerous heart rhythms. In addition, your doctor may advise you to avoid other medications, which could increase the risk of dangerous heart rhythms. In some cases, exercise can be the trigger for abnormal heart rhythms and so you may be advised to avoid certain types of exercise. You will not be prevented from taking part in all activity however, and you should discuss this with your doctor.

Such measures include: avoidance of drugs known to exacerbate the underlying condition; preventing over-heating, dehydration or loss of salts through vomiting or diarrhea; and, in some cases, reduction in exercise duration or intensity. For those whom the risk is slightly higher, regular medications such as beta-blockers can be extremely effective at reducing the risk of dangerous heart rhythms. These medications are most effective when taken regularly and consistently. For those at highest risk, an implantable cardioverter defibrillator may be recommended.

An electrocardiogram records the electrical impulse generated during each heart beat and can be used to identify normal and abnormal changes to the heart rhythm. The electrocardiogram can be done during exercise (stress test) or over 24 hours (Holter monitor) to increase the likelihood of detecting an abnormal heart rhythm.

However, it is common for a condition not to cause any symptoms on a day-to-day basis and many people with an inherited heart rhythm condition lead very normal lives. Some people may take medication to reduce the risk of dangerous heart rhythms or, less commonly, an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) may be recommended. This is a device that will detect and treat life-threatening abnormal heart rhythms. While some occupations and activities may be restricted for those with an ICD, many people live a normal life with their ICD.":{"con":{},"att":""}},"att":""},"How they can affect my family":{"con":{"The diagnosis of an inherited heart rhythm condition in a family member may provoke concern for the person affected but also anxiety that other people in the family could be at risk. Therefore, it is recommended that close relatives be checked for the same condition. There can be significant variation in the severity of a condition even between close relatives and this can sometimes be confusing. Family members may wish to learn more about the specific condition affecting their relative, in particular the symptoms or signs to look out for. Some may even decide to learn basic life support skills to use in the event of a cardiac arrest. Feelings of guilt and concern, particularly for parents of a diagnosed child, are normal but it is important to remember that many of these conditions can be managed and that family support is available.":{"con":{},"att":""}},"att":""},"Changes in Lifestyle":{"con":{"Many people with an inherited heart rhythm condition lead normal lives. However, there may be some things to consider if you are diagnosed with an inherited heart rhythm condition. You may be prescribed medication to help reduce the risk of dangerous heart rhythms. In addition, your doctor may advise you to avoid other medications, which could increase the risk of dangerous heart rhythms. In some cases, exercise can be the trigger for abnormal heart rhythms and so you may be advised to avoid certain types of exercise. You will not be prevented from taking part in all activity however, and you should discuss this with your doctor. Individuals at higher risk of dangerous rhythms may be recommended to receive a defibrillator.":{"con":{},"att":""}},"att":""},"How to mitigate risk":{"con":{"For many individuals with an inherited arrhythmia syndrome, the risk of sudden cardiac arrest is low and lifestyles measures alone are sufficient to minimize this risk. Such measures include: avoidance of drugs known to exacerbate the underlying condition; preventing over-heating, dehydration or loss of salts through vomiting or diarrhea; and, in some cases, reduction in exercise duration or intensity. For those whom the risk is slightly higher, regular medications such as beta-blockers can be extremely effective at reducing the risk of dangerous heart rhythms. These medications are most effective when taken regularly and consistently. For those at highest risk, an internal cardioverter defibrillator may be recommended. This device will monitor your heart’s rhythm and deliver life-saving treatment in the event of a cardiac arrest.":{"con":{},"att":""}},"att":""},"Getting Referred to an Expert":{"con":{"Any person with a suspected or known diagnosis of an inherited heart rhythm condition (IHRC) or a family history of an IHRC should be referred to an inherited arrhythmia clinic.

They share an increased risk of sudden cardiac arrest although this risk is highly variable between cases. Patients should be aware of potential risk modifiers or triggers for cardiac arrest: certain drugs should be avoided in specific conditions; dehydration and electrolyte loss should be treated promptly; exercise may be limited although recommendations are patient specific and should be discussed in detail. Since assessment and treatment of IHRC is a dynamic field, it is recommended that links be maintained with specialist clinics in the long-term.":{"con":{},"att":"style::b.e"}},"att":""},"What to watch for":{"con":{"Syncope is the principal red flag symptom in all IHRCs. While the majority of syncopal episodes, particularly in young patients, are vasovagal in origin, they may be caused by transient ventricular arrhythmias and so should investigated promptly. Arrhythmic syncope is universally a marker of increased risk of sudden cardiac arrest in IHRC and will therefore lead to a reassessment of risk stratification and potentially to long-term management. Other symptoms such as exertional breathlessness and chest pain may be reported in some cardiomyopathies but are not typical in primary electrical disorders":{"con":{},"att":"style::b.e"}},"att":""},"Referring a Patient":{"con":{"Patients with a suspected inherited heart rhythm condition should be referred for formal assessment at a local Inherited Arrhythmia clinic. This includes patients with a personal or family history of unexplained syncope or loss of consciousness, sudden cardiac death, or unexplained cardiac arrest. Individuals with a known family history of inherited heart rhythm conditions should also be referred for cascade screening to identify potentially at-risk family members.":{"con":{},"att":"style::b.e"}},"att":""},"Process":{"con":{"The process of referral is dependent upon the local Inherited Arrhythmia clinic.

The choice and dose of the appropriate beta-blocker will be individualized for every long-QT patient by the inherited arrhythmia clinic. Strict adherence to beta-blocker treatment is essential for optimal protection against ventricular arrhythmia. Any syncope or documented ventricular arrhythmia on beta-blockers should be reported to the inherited arrhythmia clinic and will require an urgent reassessment of the patient.":{"con":{},"att":""}},"att":"style::b.e,bb.fff,bw.10"},"Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator (ICD)":{"con":{"In accordance with current guidelines ICD implantation is indicated in long-QT patients who experience sudden cardiac arrest due to ventricular arrhythmia.1,2 Also, patients with syncope or documented ventricular arrhythmia on appropriate beta-blocker therapy will require an ICD.
